# Describing clustering through association analysis
In this part we have added cluster attribute from filters.Then select the Clustering algorithm which is SimpleKMean with different number of cluster and seed value 10.After that we apply discretization with different number of bins and than run Apriori algorithm by setting a $minimum~~support = 0.05$ and $Rules=150$.


# Experiment 1

1. Clustring Algorithm = SimpleKMean
2. Number of Cluster = 3
3. Number of bins = 3

Above are the Number of rules selected which satisfy the given condition.

### Best Rule For Cluster 1 :

Because it has higer support and confidence 1


# Experiment 2

1. Clustring Algorithm = SimpleKMean
2. Number of Cluster = 3
3. Number of bins = 6

### Best Rule For Cluster 1 :

Because it has higer support and confidence 1


# Experiment 3

1. Clustring Algorithm = SimpleKMean
2. Number of Cluster = 6
3. Number of bins = 3

# Experiment 4

1. Clustring Algorithm = SimpleKMean
2. Number of Cluster = 6
3. Number of bins = 6

Above are the Number of rules selected which satisfy the given condition.

### Best Rule For Cluster 1 :

There is no such a rule which satisfy Cluster 1 


# Conclusion

From these 4 experiments, we can see that in experiment 3, there is one rule which satisfy the cluster 1 but, In experiment 4, when we increase number of clusters as well as number of bins we found no such a rule which satisfy the cluster 1. In order to get the best result, we should select the appropriate number of clusters as well as number of bins.
