# 732A75-Advanced-Data-Mining


## Lab 1
* Gain familiarity with the data mining toolkit, Weka
* Learn to apply clustering algorithms using Weka
* Understand outputs produced by clustering tools in Weka

## Lab 2
Cluster a given dataset and use association analysis to describe the clusters obtained. 

## Lab 3
Appreciate the importance of the distance metric used within the clustering algorithm, e.g. the clusters found by the algorithm may not correspond to the clustering that is most natural for us human beings.
