In this lab we perform cluster analysis and then association anaysis of __monk__ dataset. Then we will compare the results.


# Cluster Analysis
We perform cluster analysis by using two different clustering algorithms that are `"Simple K-means"` and 
`"Make Density Based Cluster"`. We perform clustering by keeping different number of clusters and and also for different standard deviation.We have kept the seed value same throughout the experiments which is 10. 

## Experiment 1

1. Clustring Algorithm = SimpleKMean
2. Number of Cluster = 2

## Experiment 2

1. Clustring Algorithm = SimpleKMeans
2. Number of Cluster = 5

## Experiment 3

1. Clustring Algorithm = MakeDensityBasedCluster
2. Number of Cluster = 2
3. Standard Deviation = 1x10^-6

## Experiment 4

1. Clustring Algorithm = MakeDensityBasedCluster
2. Number of Cluster = 2
3. Standard Deviation = 1

## Experiment 8

1. Clustring Algorithm = MakeDensityBasedCluster
2. Number of Cluster = 5
3. Standard Deviation = 100

## Analysis: 

From the above 8 experiments, it can be observed that for every clustering method, the sum of squared error is too high. And it can also be seen that if number of clusters is increased, the data is classified in such a way that except for cluster 0 and 1 other clusters do not belong to any specified class (that is `no class` is assiggned to it).

It can also be seen that for every experiment, the percentage of __incorrectly clustered instances__ is approximately 50% or more.Increasing the number of clusters does not improve the clustering. 

In Make Density based clustering, for the same number of clusters, the log likelihood and incorrectly clustered instances remain same even if the standard deviation is changed.

It implies that clustering algorithm does not perform well on monk dataset. The primary reason for this misclassification is the distribution of data.

## Visualization:

By visually innspecting the clustering result, we get the following output:

By visually inspecting clustering, it can be observed that the data off diffferent attributes in the dataset are closely related to each other and it is difficult to classify them.

# Association Analysis

In this part we have performed association analysis using `"Apriori"` algorithm.

We have kept the settings as follows :
 
1. Minimum support = 0.05
2. Number of Rules = 19

Rest of the settings are kept default.

We get the following result:

## Selected Rules For Class 1:
